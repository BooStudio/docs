# Introduction

## Preface

This section of the documentation will contain various tutorials. These are guides that are designed to take you from beginning to end on building various types of projects with Masonite. We may not explain things in much detail for each section as this part of the documentation is designed to just get you familiar with the inner workings of Masonite.

Since this section of the documentation is designed to just get you up and coding with Masonite, any further explanations that should be presented are inside various "hint blocks." Once you are done with the tutorial or simply want to learn more about a topic it is advised that you go through each hint block and follow the links to dive deeper into the reference documentation which does significantly more explaining.

## Hint Blocks

You will see various hint blocks throughout the tutorials. Below are examples of what the various colors represent.

{% hint style="success" %}
You'll see hint blocks that are green which you should follow if you want to learn more information about the topic currently being discussed.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You'll also see hint blocks that are blue. These should not be ignored and typically contain background information you need to further understand something.
{% endhint %}

## Installation

This tutorial will assume you have already installed Masonite. If you haven't, be sure to read the [Installation](../) guide to get a fresh install of Masonite up and running. Once you have one up and running or if you already have it running, go ahead and start at [Creating A Blog](creating-a-blog.md).
