## What Is Masonite ORM

Masonite ORM is a first-party ORM and database layer built by Masonite maintainers. The ORM is built to be used outside of Masonite and inside any framework related or non-framework related project. It can be used standalone, inside Flask or even Django (TODO: check this. I don't see why not). 

## Masonite ORM or Orator?

Masonite ORM is made to be able to a drop in replacement for Orator, with some exceptions. There are some features that orator has that Masonite does not but for 95% of use cases, Masonite ORM can be a replacement for your project.
